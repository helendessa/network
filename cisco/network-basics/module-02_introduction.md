# Clients and Servers
Hosts: computer connected to a network that participate directly in network communication.  

Computer hosts can act as a client, a server, or both.
The software installed on the computer determines which role it plays.

- Server: provide information to other hosts on the network.
- Client: request and display the info obtained from the server.

## Client and Servers Roles
- Email: runs email server software. Client use mail client software, as Microsoft Outlook, Gmail.  
- Web: runs web server software. Client use browser software, as Vivaldi, Google Chrome, Falkon.  
- File: stores corporate and user files in a central location. Client devices access these files with client software, as Windows File Explorer.  

## Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Networks  
A network where computers function as the servers and clients.  

Advantages
- Easy to set-up.  
- Less complex.  
- Lower cost.  
- Can be used for simple tasks.  

Disadvantages
- No centralized administration.   
- Not as secure.  
- No scalable.  
- Can have a slower perfomance.  

### Applications
Require that each device provide a user interface and run a background service.  
Some use a hybrid system:
- The shared is decentralized.  
- The indexes that point to resource locations are stored in a centralized directory.  
- Each peer accesses an index server to get the location of a resource stored on another peer.  
- Both clients can simultaneously send and receive messages.

## Multiple roles in the network
- A server can provide services for simultaneously to one or many clients.  
- A computer can run multiple types of server software (ex.: email, web and file server).

# Network infrastructure
The platform that supports the network. 
Three categories:  
- End devices.  
- Intermediate devices.  
- Network media.
