# Wireless networks
Types:
- **GPS (Global Positioning System)**: uses satellites to transmit signals that cover the globe.  
- **Bluetooth**: low power, short range wireless technology that is intended to replace wired connectivity for accessories such as speakers, headphones, and microphones.
    - Can be used to transmit both data and voice.  
    - Also to create small local networks.  
    - Mutiple devices can be connect at the same time.  
- **Wi-fi**: their transmitters and receivers located within the smartphone enable the phone to connect to local networks and the internet.
    - Needs to be within the range of the signal from a wireless network access point.  
    - Usually private owned but often provide guest or public access hotsposts.  
    - Hotspots is an area where Wi-fi signals are available.   
- **NFC (Near Field Communication)**: enables to exchange data by devices that are in very close proximity to each other, usually less than a few centimeters.  
    - Ex.: contactless credit card payments.
