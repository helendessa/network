# Network Types

Internet is a worldwide collection of **inter**connected **net**works.

## Local Networks
- All sizes.
- Small office/home office: SOHO; share resources as printers, docs, pics etc between a few local users.
- Ex.: small home networks, SOHO, medium to large networks, ww networks.

## Mobile Networks
- Ex.: smartphone, tablet, smartwatch, smart glasses.

## Connected Home Devices
- Ex.: security system, appliances, smart TV, gaming console.

## Other
- Ex.: smart cars, RFID tags, sensors and actuators, medical devices.

# Data Transmission
Information that you input.
- **Volunteer data**: knowlingly and willingly provided.
- **Infered data**: basead on activities/patterns, often w/o explicit knowledge. *predicted*
- **Observed data**: collected through observation of actions/environment, as location or sensor readings. *collected*

## The Bit
- **Bi**nary digi**t**.  
- 1 = on, 0 = off.  
- Smallest piece of data.  
- All data is processed and stored as binary.
- Binary code is used to represent and interpret letters, numbers, special characters with bits. Ex.: American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII).  
- Byte: group of eight bits. 

## Common Methods of Data Transmission
- Data converted to series of bits -> converted into signals.  
- Signal: eletrical or optical patterns transmitted from device to another.  
- Transmitted as a series of pulses of eletricity, light, or radio waves.  
- Signals may be converted before reaching the destination.

Three common methods of signal transmission:
- Eletrical signals (eletrical pulses).  
- Optical signals (ligth pulses).  
- Wireless signals (infrared, microwave or radio waves).  

## Questions

02. When using your credit card to make purchases at several places, the credit card company can use this information to learn about your location and your preferences. This type of personal data is known as:
a. secret data.  
**b. inferred data**.  ✅  
c. observed data.  
d. volunteered data.  

03. Which of the following methods of signal transmission uses frequencies or pulses of light?
**a. optical signals**. ✅  
b. electrical signals.  
c. wireless signals.  

# Bandwidth
Bandwidth is the capacity of a medium to carry data.
- Digital bandwidth measures the amount of data that can flow from one place to another in a given amount of time.  
- Bits/s.
    - Thousands of bits per second (Kbps).  
    - Millions of bits per second (Mbps).  
    - Billions of bits per second (Gbps).

# Throughput
Also the measure of the transfer of bits across the media over a given period of time, but doesn't usually match
the specified bandwidth (+delays in both directions).  
Many factors influence throughput, including:
- The amount of data being sent/received.  
- The types of data being transmitted.  
- The latence created by the number of networks encountered between source and destination.  

Important:
- Don't take into account validity/usefulness of the bits being transmitted/received.    
- Can't be faster than the slowest link of the path from sending/receiving device.
