## Typical Home Network Routers
Small business and home routers typically have two primary types of ports:
- Ethernet: connect to the internal switch portion of the router. 
    - Usually labeled “Ethernet” or “LAN”. 
    - All devices connected to the switch ports are on the same local network.
- Internet: connect the device to another network. 
    - Connects the router to a different network than the Ethernet ports. 
    - Often used to connect to the cable or DSL modem in order to access the internet.  

In addition to the wired ports, many home routers include a radio antenna and a built-in wireless access point.
- By default, the wireless devices are on the same local network as the devices that are physically plugged into the LAN switch ports. 
- The internet port is the only port that is on a different network in the default configuration.
